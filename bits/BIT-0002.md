## Abstract

This proposal addresses the issue of weight copying in Bittensor subnets, where malicious validators inflate their trust metrics to gain higher dividends. The solution leverages an EVM-compatible smart contract to perform on-chain rewards calculation, thereby preventing validators from manipulating weights through weight copying. The Yuma consensus would be applied to the rewards function's subparameters rather than the final validator weights, ensuring integrity while maintaining validator anonymity.

## Motivation

The weight copying problem occurs when validators artificially increase their trust by copying or averaging weights within the Yuma consensus. This leads to unfair dividend distribution and undermines the integrity of the validator trust metric. Current methods, such as commit-reveal schemes, expose input data, which can be exploited for copying, while zero-knowledge proofs are too computationally expensive. This proposal's on-chain approach aligns validator incentives with honest behavior, securing rewards distribution within Bittensor and forcing validators to actually run the subnet's codebase.

## Specification

1. **On-Chain Rewards Calculation Using EVM**  
   The rewards function is implemented as an EVM-compatible smart contract. Validators submit validation results to this contract, which calculates miners weights, ensuring they cannot easily manipulate inputs to inflate trust.

2. **Yuma Consensus on Subparameters**  
   The Yuma consensus applies to the subparameters/inputs of the rewards function rather than the final weights, preventing weight copying. By consensus-verifying subparameters, validators cannot imitate the results of others to gain higher rewards unless they accumulate and maintain a large enough dataset of validator outputs, for every subnet, which would be impractical and more time-consuming than simply running a legitimate validator.

3. **Subnet Owner Key Restriction**  
   The rewards function contract ownership is restricted to the subnet owner key, who is the only entity authorized to edit or update the contract. This ensures a controlled governance model, preventing unauthorized modifications.

4. **Data Security and Logging**  
   Validator inputs are excluded from external logging services (e.g., `wandb`) to prevent reverse-engineering and secure validator data.

## Rationale

This design was chosen to provide a trustless on-chain rewards calculation, removing manipulation risks. Alternative approaches, such as commit-reveal schemes and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), were considered but ultimately rejected:
   
   - **Commit-Reveal Schemes:** While useful for securing some validation processes, commit-reveal schemes expose input data that can be reverse-engineered, allowing malicious validators to mimic results.
   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** ZKPs allow proof of calculations without exposing inputs but are computationally intensive and increase gas costs. Given Bittensor's current capabilities, ZKPs were deemed inefficient.

This on-chain solution improves validator integrity, aligns incentives with honest behavior, and offers a more manageable gas footprint.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal introduces no backward incompatibilities, as it operates within the existing EVM compatibility layer on Bittensor.

## Reference Implementation (Optional)

A Solidity reference implementation for the rewards function is included below. It enforces restricted access, subparameter-based consensus, and secure interaction with the Bittensor Subtensor contract.

## Security Considerations

This design mitigates the weight copying problem by applying consensus to subparameters and enforcing an on-chain rewards function. By restricting contract editing to the subnet owner, it ensures controlled governance. Excluding input data from external logging services also prevents unauthorized access to validator inputs. However, the on-chain calculation may introduce higher gas costs, which should be monitored as the system scales.

Shall Bittensor move away from a Proof of Authority chain, the sensitive inputs of the rewards calculation will have to be obfuscated to prevent node owners from using them to weight copy.
